# End-to-end Learning for Self-driving Cars


## Introduction

In this tutorial, I will walk you through the process of designing an end-to-end learning model for a self-driving car using the resources provided by [Udacity](https://in.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013). We will use the tools provided by Udacity to the public. I have customized some of those files, and I have shared all the necessary files in this [google-drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13_9sMv5LcyGX5oo29x41sUwFhXkNbgWV). You can use them to follow along.

You can go through the following resources to understand the concept of end-to-end learning:
- [Siraj's Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaY5QiZwSP4)
- [NVDIA's Research Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316.pdf)
- [Udacity Behavioral Cloning Project](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3)

### Overview of the tutorial:
- **Project Environment Setup**

- **Data collection and Preprocessing**

- **Data Augmentation**

- **Design CNN to Clone Car's Behavior**

- **Testing the Performance of the Learning Model**
